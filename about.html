              The History:
              The Bike Affair was opened in August 2009. Back then we were riders. Recreational cycling was something that hadn't yet become mainstream in Hyderabad, and there were no shop adressing biker's need . Yes, there were shops selling bikes, but with every visit to the local bike store, we realised how discouraging an interaction could be. In time, our frustration became the motivation to open a bike shop which will be honest to customer and their needs, give professional support and service and which will encourage people to try and take up bicycling as a way of life. Our focus was solving the problems that we our self have faced as customer.</p>
